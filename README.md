# # Raspberry Pi powered cocktail machine

This is the code for the cocktail machine i created. I am not a programmer and this is my first projekt ever but i try my best. The Machine has 5 basis liquids that can be mixed together to create a varietys of different cocktails. There is pressure applied to the bottles with a pump that pushes air into them. Upon opening magnetic valves that are controlled by relays the liquid can be poured into a glass. The specific amount of the liquids obviously is not always the same, so the valves are controlled by a scale the glass is placed on.

## Getting Started

I usally have the most recent version of raspbian running on my RPi 3. This however should not matter too much. It should also work on other RPis. Only tested it for the Zero W though.
